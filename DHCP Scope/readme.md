Paessler PRTG Sensor to check DHCP Scope

This script could be used to monitor all scopes of a DHCP Server

Add this script to C:\Program Files (x86)\PRTG Network Monitor\Custom Sensors\EXEXML and create a EXE/Script Advanced Sensor.
Specify the computer to query via parameters. Placeholders like %host can be used.
